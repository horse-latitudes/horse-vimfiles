# You can get your long keyid from

#
# If you have a v4 key, it will simply be the last 16 digits of
# your fingerprint.
#
# Example:
#   $CONFIG{'keyid'} = [ qw{FEDCBA9876543210} ];
#  or, if you have more than one key:
#   $CONFIG{'keyid'} = [ qw{0123456789ABCDEF 89ABCDEF76543210} ];

#Hi,
#
#please find attached the user id{(scalar @uids >= 2 ? 's' : '')}
#{foreach $uid (@uids) {
#    $OUT .= "\t".$uid."\n";
#};}of your key {$key} signed by me.
#
#If you have multiple user ids, I sent the signature for each user id
#separately to that user id's associated email address. You can import
#the signatures by running each through `gpg --import`.
#
#Note that I did not upload your key to any keyservers. If you want this
#new signature to be available to others, please upload it yourself.
#With GnuPG this can be done using
#	gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-key {$key}
#
#If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
#
#Regards,
